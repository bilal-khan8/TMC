        As a React Developer, Iâ€™ve crafted dynamic, user-friendly interfaces
        for various web applications. My work includes building reusable
        components, managing state with Redux and Context API, and
        integrating APIs seamlessly. I focus on performance optimization and
        responsive design to ensure smooth user experiences across devices.
        My experience also involves testing with Jest and React Testing
        Library to deliver reliable and high-quality applications.
